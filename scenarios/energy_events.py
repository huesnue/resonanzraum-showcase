Event Timeline 2021–2025 for Energy System Simulation

Each event represents a real-world geopolitical or structural change
mapped into the Resonanzraum-Modell via ΔZ (stress), capacity, or coupling.

Mapping:
- supply_shock → production drops
- demand_shock → consumption increases/decreases
- capacity_shock → infrastructure degradation
- coupling_shift → structural reconfiguration (C_eff)
- uncertainty_shock → system-wide stress amplification
- variability_shock → volatility in supply
